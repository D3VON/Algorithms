<P>For program 3, implement heapsort. You'll need to write your own =
heapify=20
routines (they're all in the book). Make sure you index your heap from =
zero, and=20
use the fast (amortized linear time) build_heap function.</P>
<P>Input and output will be slightly different from the prior two =
assignments.=20
The data will be ordered in PAIRS of integers. The first integer is the =
student=20
ID number (think in terms of the Binghamton B-number). The second =
integer is the=20
social security number. You will print out the students ordered by their =
B=20
number. For example</P>
<P>53 123456789<BR>22 987654321<BR>37 555555555<BR>44 666666666</P>
<P>should be sorted using heapsort, and printed as</P>
<P>22 987654321<BR>37 555555555<BR>44 666666666<BR>53 123456789</P>
<P>Do not print out any other information, or pause on the output, and =
so on.=20
I'll be checking the results against the output of my code, and if you =
print=20
anything extra, it makes checking much more difficult.</P>
