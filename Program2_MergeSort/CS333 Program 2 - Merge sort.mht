<BODY>
<P>For program 2, implement merge sort. MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE =
BOOK!</P>
<P>Same sorting plan as with Insertion Sort (largest to smallest), same =
input=20
format. Submit this through the Blackboard Digital dropbox, and please =
tag this=20
as "PROGRAM 2". </P>
<P>Due: February 12th, 2009 (before Midnight).</P>
<P>Some things to note:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Put your name into the source code comments!=20
  <LI>Make sure you sort in reverse order (largest to smallest)=20
  <LI>Please don't submit things in a TAR/RAR/TGZ file. You only need =
one file=20
  to implement everything, and a Makefile is not required. I can =
unzip/untar,=20
  but it's a hassle.=20
  <LI>Don't put in any extra output, or prompting. It makes automatic =
checking=20
  of the output difficult.=20
  <LI>The code should compile.=20
  <LI>The code should not be windows-specific. It should compile and run =
on Unix=20
  machines. </LI></UL>
<P>Prior grading deducted 1 point for a missing name; I'll increase this =
to=20
3.</P>
<P>5 points off for printing in the wrong order.</P>
<P>10 points off if it doesn't work (and have a O(n log n) =
complexity).</P>
<P> </P>
